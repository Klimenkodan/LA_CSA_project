# LA_CSA_project
The Linear algebra library, that provides you with a number of linear algebra functions.
The files that you use are wrapper_class/matrix.cpp, where the definition of wrapper class and some useful
functions(copy, representation and so on) are given.
You will also use src/matrix_operations.cpp file where you can find most useful matrix operations.
And the last file that might help you is src/vector_operations.cpp functions of which also work with matrix wrapper class,
but also can work with vector of vectors from standard c++ library.
